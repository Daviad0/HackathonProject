**Notice: Due to using the Azure Free Plan, we only have 60 min per day of computing time. All of the files help to create a .NET Core Blazor web app. The manual publish folder is also included in PolarHub/PolarHub/bin/Release. Thank you!**
## Home Screen
Welcome to our project for the kuriushacks hackathon, with this website and a short implementation of EchoAR we provide a solution for the third prompt given to us by the Canadian Polar Bear Habitat. The home screen contains a basic overview of what CPBH is about.  You can find the navigation bar located directly under the header.
## Activities
First let’s go to activities. We have a number of virtual activities including polar bear trivia, a photo matching game, a “personality” quiz, coloring sheets, and a word search. Let’s take a look at a sample trivia question, you can select answers with unlimited tries. We also have this matching memorization game. We have another short personality quiz. Some of the downloadable activities we have include a few options of coloring pages and a word search. We also have another activity where you can “adopt/create” your own virtual polar bear and give it it’s own name and personality. As you navigate through the website, you earn points that display themselves at the top right corner of your browser. Once you have 100% you earn a certificate.
## AR/VR:
On the activity page we have a short section that shows a 3d model of what a polar bear looks like and another one pointing out the specific anatomy of polar bears.

## Climate Change
Next up on our navigation bar we have “About Climate Change”. Here we have a short overview of global warming  and how it’s affecting our ecosystem. The footer contains links that give access to more information and donation links.
## Educational videos
Moving on to the next thing, we have a short section for educational videos. Here we have embedded some videos that help you learn more about Polar Bears. 
## Timeline
Next up, we have the timeline. This displays what the year looks like for the Polar Bears. It also contains in depth explanations of their behaviors in each season. 
## The Bears
Moving on, modeled after the original Canadian Polar Bear Habitat website, this is a small page that introduces all of the bears that live here. For more information you can go to the Candadian Polar Bear Habitat website's page.
## About
Last but not least, we have the About page. This has an explanation of the site and all of the links and sources we used to create our website.
